                    This year we are once again focusing on these 3 major issues: contributing to the reopening of the
                    NYC economy, bringing focus to the anti-Asian + other hate crime issues and promoting vaccinations,
                    and post-covid mental and physical wellness. HKDBFNY 2022 features events for the entire family, an
                    opening day parade at noon on Saturday and the US Dragon Boat Open Championship Race on Sunday.
                    Racing both days from 9am-5pm. Some of the attractions taking place during the festival include
                    several special races. Including the Hong Kong SAR 25th Anniversary Challenge, the Sponsors
                    Challenge, a Media Invitational, the Womens Invitational, and the Seniors Invitational. This year's
                    Corporate Invitational looks to be a good one, with a number of Corporate Teams joining us to race
                    for their companies. There are also special Youth, Educational and Health Care Invitationals and the
                    always exciting and rewarding Charity race, featuring funds raised by the participating teams to be
                    donated to the charities designated by the winning teams. Over the years the Charity Race has
                    contributed in excess of $300,000 to various NYC charities.
