                    The tradition of Dragon Boat Racing is an annual Chinese rite commemorating the idealistic poet and
                    performer Qu Yuan who drowned himself in the third century B.C. to protest against his emperor's
                    policies. The locals raced in their boats in an attempt to rescue the poet. To prevent fish and
                    water dragons from eating his body, the locals beat their drums and splashed their paddles. This was
                    the beginning of Dragon Boat Racing.<br><br>

                    Admission to the HKDBF-NY was Free, with Events taking place under beautiful skies, the weather
